# Exploratory Data Analysis - Assignment 1

This repository contains my submission for the Exploratory Data Analysis Assignment 1.

## Assignment Description

The assignment required me to recreate specific plots using the "Individual household electric power consumption" dataset. I've organized the R scripts and PNG files in the "Rscripts" and "png" folder respectively.

## Instructions

To recreate the plots, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open and run the R scripts located in the "Rscripts" folder.
3. The plots will be generated as PNG files in the main directory.

## Repository Organization

- `Rscripts`: Contains R scripts to generate the plots.
- `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png`, `plot4.png`: Generated plot files.


## Notes

Feel free to explore the R scripts and plots. If you have any questions, please let me know.
